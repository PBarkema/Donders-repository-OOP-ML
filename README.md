# Donders-repository-OOP-ML
This repository contains code examples for Object Oriented Programming in C# and some machine learning example code.

Object Oriented Programming (C#):

In total, I have written ~15-20 programs for courses in C#. Some for algorithm, ML or data structure courses, some for OOP-based courses.
1) I have included different samples of OOP to solve sudokus.
a) In the first project, the assignment was to solve sudokus using constraint-based search algorithms.
b) In the second project, the assignment was to solve sudokus with prepositional logic. The code structure was provided by the course and the student had to implement it, demonstrating my ability to read - and work with - existing OOP code.

2) I have also included a basic game 'Reversi' developed using OOP in my first C# course.
The code shows an implementation of a basic checkers-like game, where user moves are validated and approved; including a helper function to advise future moves.

Machine Learning code (Python):

I have provided two samples of Machine Learning code for hackathons I participated in.
1) Echobox challenge: I independently wrote code to cluster raw news data into breaking news events, and created automated reports on information.
2) Time-series anomaly detection: My team constructed and optimized a Deep Neural Network and beat the standing high score in a Master's course at a top tech university (Tsinhua University). Besides project management, my engineering responsibility was to deseasonalize the data and construct a DNN with Keras.
